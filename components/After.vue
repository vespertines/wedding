      <p>We’re planning to go to Jeju Island to spend for a few days to have chill and relaxing times after the wedding. It’d be so great if you could join us some times there! It’s very beautiful island and has unique and special cultures. Highly recommend to travel while you’re in South Korea. Let us know if you’re also planning to go we can organise something together.</p>
