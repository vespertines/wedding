      <h3>Jeju Island</h3>
      <p>
        We’re planning to go to Jeju Island a few days to chill and relax after
        the wedding (17 - 21 May). there are a few flight departing from Gimhae
        airport. It would be great if you would join us there!
      </p>
      <p>
        It is a very beautiful island with a unique and special culture. We
        highly recommend a visit there while you’re in South Korea.
      </p>
      <p>
        If it becomes a group we suggest to stay here (7-10 Max / up to £370 per
        day) but if it becomes larger number we can find other places or happy
        to have an accommodation separately.
      </p>
      <p>
        Also it depends on number of people we can plan how to get the airport
        together.
